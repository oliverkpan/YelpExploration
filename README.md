# YelpExploration

### About
In prior projects, I have explored regression and classification. However in machine learning, there is also importance in understanding clustering. In the past, I attended a Yelp Networking event, in which I was introduced to Yelp's Open dataset. The focus of this project is clustering various businesses and to analyze how businesses have adjusted in the time of COVID. 

### Current Progress
Currently, I am implementing the elbow method and silhouette method to select the number of clusters. I will continue to visualize the clusters in various notebooks.

### Machine Learning
[KMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)

### Next Steps
I am hoping to strengthen my documentation and understanding of various clustering techniques. Here are the next steps for this project

1. Explore and create visualizations to further understand the data
2. Analyze highlights column and understand the further breakdown of data
3. Try and test new clustering libraries.
4. Create new features that may assist with determining business success
5. Potentially create time series data with closed_until category
